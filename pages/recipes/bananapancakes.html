   <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
<ul>
   <li><strong>Flour</strong></li>
   All-purpose flour contains gluten, a protein that gives the pancakes structure <br>and pleasant chewiness.
    <li><strong>Sugar</strong></li>
   Granulated sugar adds sweetness, helps hold in moisture, and may create a <br>tender texture.
    <li><strong>Baking Powder</strong></li>
    Baking powder is a leavener. It creates air bubbles in the batter, which <br>ensures light and fluffy pancakes.
   <li><strong>Salt</strong></li>
    Salt adds subtle depth to all sorts of sweet dishes, including pancakes. <br>You won't be able to detect it in the finished product, but you'll miss it if you leave it out.
    <li><strong>An Egg</strong></li>
    Eggs work with the other ingredients to bind and provide structure. The <br>fatty yolks also add rich flavor and extra moisture.
    <li><strong>Milk</strong></li>
    Not only does milk add flavor, it is the liquid base that's essential for <br>dissolving the dry ingredients and creating a cohesive batter.
    <li><strong>Vegetable Oil</strong></li>
    Vegetable oil is harder to burn than butter, so it's a great fat to use in <br>banana pancakes. It keeps the pancakes moist and prevents them from sticking to the pan.
    <li><strong>Bananas</strong></li>
    Last but certainly not least, you'll need two mashed bananas for these pancakes.<br> The bananas will help hold the other ingredients together and add mellow, fruity flavor.
<h3><em>Steps</em></h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Mix</strong></li>
    Combine your dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, baking powder) in one bowl<br> and your wet ingredients (egg, milk, vegetable oil, mashed bananas) in another bowl.<br> Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the wet ingredients, then stir until they're incorporated. <br>It's OK if your batter is slightly lumpy.
    <li><strong>Cook</strong></li>
    Pour the batter in Â¼ cup portions onto a lightly oiled pan or griddle over medium-high<br> heat. Cook for a few minutes, flip with a spatula, and cook for another few<br> minutes (or until each side is golden brown).
    <li><strong>Serve</strong></li>
    Serve your banana pancakes immediately. They're delicious alone or with your favorite <br>pancake toppings.
